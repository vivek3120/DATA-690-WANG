#                                         Notes from cheat sheet.

-> If  you want to write the heading(with bold and big text) use # for it, and add # as your heading number increases. Eg.
# Subjects (heading1)
## Course  (heading2)
.
.
##### Teachers (heading5)

-> If you want to write anything in bold, use ** f ** without space. f= text which you want to see in bold.
**DS690**.

-> If you want to write anything in italics, use * italicized text * without space.
*Data science*

-> To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> Today is my first class of DS690.

-> Ordered List
1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.

-> Unordered List
- First item.
- Second item.
- Third item.

-> To denote a word or phrase as code,we should enclose that in backticks (`).

->To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
*** , ___ , ---

-> To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses.
[title](https. whatever the link is).

-> To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses.
In this way we can add image with some description on it.

# common data types
 - Integer
 - Float
 - Boolean
 - String
 
# Libraries

# Installation and setup
 Go to python.organd download it from there After that, to install jupyter notebook go to command prompt and type the command through which you want to download(given in jupyter notebook website)
 
# Basic idea on what python is and for what it is used.
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

# common binary operators

a + b Add a and b
a - b Subtract b from a
a * b Multiply a by b
a / b Divide a by b
a // b Floor-divide a by b, dropping any fractional remainder
a ** b Raise a to the b power
