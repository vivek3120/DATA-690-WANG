   **Notes for Class1(cheat sheet)**

-> For writing the heading(with bold and big text) use # for it, and add # as your heading number increases. Eg
          #Subjects(Heading 1)
          ##course(Heading 2)
	  .
	  ..
	  ...
	  ######teachers(Heading 3)
          
-> For writing anything in bold, use "f" without space.   
f= text you want to write in bold
example: **DS690"

-> For writing anything in italics,use "italicized text" without space.
example : "Data Science"

-> For creating a blockquote, add a > in front of the paragraph.
example : > Yesterday was my first class of DS690

-> Ordered List
1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.

-> Unordered List
- First item.
- Second item.
- Third item.

-> To denote a word or phrase as code, we should enclose that in closed braces (.)

-> To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks(***), hyphens(---) or underscores(___) in a line by themselves.

-> To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it with URL in paranthesis.
[title][https.(the link)]

-> To add an image, add an exclamation mark(!), followed by alt text in braces, and the path or URL to image asset in paranthesis.

**Data Types**
 - Integer
 - Float
 - String
 - Boolean
 
**Libraries**

**Installation and setup**
 Go to python.org and download it from there. After that to install jupyter notebook, go to command prompt and type the command through which you want to download(given in   jupyter notebook website)


PYTHON:
Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. It’s a great first language because it’s concise and easy to read. Python is used from web development to machine learning to data science. It can be used on a server to create web applications.

For data analysis and interactive computing and data visualization, Python will inevitably draw comparisons with other open source and commercial programming languages and tools in wide use, such as R, MATLAB, SAS and others. In recent years, Python’s improved support for libraries (such as pandas and scikit-learn) has made it a popular choice for data analysis tasks.

ESSENTIAL PYTHON LIBRARIES:
1. Scrapy: 
One of the most popular Python data science libraries, Scrapy helps to build crawling programs that can retrieve structured data from the web, for example, URLs or contact info. It's a great tool for scraping data used in, for example, Python machine learning models. 

2. BeautifulSoup:
BeautifulSoup is another really popular library for web crawling and data scraping. If you want to collect data that’s available on some website but not via a proper CSV or API, BeautifulSoup can help you scrape it and arrange it into the format you need.

3. NumPy:
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations. It provides the data structures, algorithms and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. NumPy contains, among other things:
•	A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray.
•	Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays.
•	Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk.

4. SciPy:
This useful library includes modules for linear algebra, integration, optimization, and statistics. Its main functionality was built upon NumPy, so its arrays make use of this library. SciPy works great for all kinds of scientific programming projects (science, mathematics, and engineering). It offers efficient numerical routines such as numerical optimization, integration, and others in submodules. The extensive documentation makes working with this library really easy.
SciPy packages
Scipy. integrate
	It solves differential equations.
Scipy. linalg
	Linear algebra routines and matrix decompositions extending beyond those provided in numpy. Linalg
Scipy. signal
	Signal processing tools
  
5.Pandas:
Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. It's based on two main data structures: "Series" (one-dimensional, like a list of items) and "Data Frames" (two-dimensional, like a table with multiple columns). Pandas allows converting data structures to DataFrame objects, handling missing data, and adding/deleting columns from DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data with histogram or plot box. It’s a must-have for data wrangling, manipulation, and visualization.

6. SciKit-learn:
This is an industry-standard for data science projects based in Python. Scikits is a group of packages in the SciPy Stack that were created for specific functionalities – for example, image processing. Scikit-learn uses the math operations of SciPy to expose a concise interface to the most common machine learning algorithms. 

7. Matplotlib:
This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects - it provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. 

8. IPython and Jupyter:
IPython is an interactive shell for python programming language that offers enhanced introspection, additional shell syntax, tab completion and rich history.
The Jupyter notebook system allows you to author content in Markdown and HTML, providing you a means to create rich documents with code and text.

#Installation and Setup

Go to python.org and download it. After downloading, install jupyter notebook. Inorder to install jupyter notebook go to command prompt and type the command which you need to download.
